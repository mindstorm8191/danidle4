Gregtech Idle
Idle game inspired by Gregtech (and Factory Idle coupled with Reactor Idle)


game will behave a lot like factory idle: different places will generate goods, other places
  will consume them.  However, user will have to hire and keep workers paid, and provide the tools
  needed to keep them working (except the first 3 that the game starts with)
any and all items can be sold in bulk, or by being sent to a selling station

stick source --> shovel producer
shovels open up gravel source
gravel source (requires shovel) --> flint filter (requires shovel) --> flint axe, shovel, pickaxe
flint pickaxe opens up rock source
rock --> stone blocks --> stone oven
rock --> copper filter (requires pickaxe) --> copper smelter (requires oven)
log source (requires axe) --> charcoal (requires oven)

Item movement
Items will need to be moved about from machine to machine in order for everything to work.
Bucket-line: Players will start by using lines of workers to transport items, one at a time,
	     between shops.  This won't be very cost-effective, but will not require any equipment,
	     besides the workers.  While being basic, this method will also allow the most
	     flexibility, enabling sorting and routing management, even early in the game.  Players
	     will likely keep using single workers for routing management even when higher level
	     flow options exist.
Ramps: Ramps can be loaded items by the workers to move items one block in the same direction.  This
       can help reduce the total number of workers in the bucket lines
Roller ramps: Like normal ramps, but can be extended for many blocks, but only in straight lines
Steam belts: Can move items automatically between machines.  Compared to later options, this will
	     be a bit slow.
Linked Steam Belts: these pass steam power as well as items, allowing you to improve your layout
Electric belts: These can be run at much higher speeds, allowing much better logistical management
Linked Electric Belts: Passes electric power as well as items.
Air plates: These can toss items from one side of your factory to the other, but only in straight
	    lines.  Air plates will have some restrictions on what can be passed this way (anything
	    fragile / volatile is probably a bad idea).  Requires a linked catch-plate for the items
	    to stop at
Teleporter: Automatically move items to where-ever you want them.  Requires a lot of power input.




Player starts by having an exploration token.  By using it, they find a
forest.  They can then upgrade that to start producing sticks.

With 10 sticks, they can produce a shovel.  With 10 shovels, they can have
a second exploration token.  Using that gives them dirt and gravel sources

1st great exploration = forest (yields 100 sticks, 600 logs), dirt field (yields 1000 dirt, 800 gravel)
trees --> sticks
sticks --> wooden shovel
shovel --> dirt & gravel
gravel + sticks --> flint pickaxe
gravel + sticks --> flint shovel (increases dirt & gravel production)
gravel + sticks --> flint axe (starts basic log production)
gravel + sticks --> flint spears
log + flint axe use --> lumber
log + flint axe use --> sticks (low yield)
10 flint spears --> 2nd great exploration - gain copper ore, stone, clay,
	tin ore, water sources
stone + clay + (lots of) dirt --> wood farm
stone + clay --> furnace
furnace + stone + clay --> charcoal furnace
furnace + -wood- --> charcoal
furnace + -charcoal- + -copper ore- --> copper ingot
furnace + -charcoal- + -tin ore- --> tin ingot
sticks + stone --> stone hammer
stone hammer (use) + -copper ingot- --> copper dust
stone hammer (use) + -tin ingot- --> tin dust
-copper dust (x3)- + -tin dust- --> bronze dust
furnace + -bronze dust- --> bronze ingot
sticks + bronze ingot --> bronze hammer (lasts much longer than stone hammer)
-bronze ingot- + bronze hammer (use) --> bronze plate
sticks + bronze plate --> bronze chisel
sticks + bronze chisel + bronze plate --> bronze file
filed bronze plates --> boiler
filed bronze plates --> steam pipes
filed bronze plates --> water pipes
filed bronze plates --> gears
filed bronze plates + gears --> steam-powered conveyor
bronze plates + gears --> steam furnace (can be connected with conveyors)
bronze plates + gears --> steam ore crusher (increases material yield)
bronze plates + gears --> steam saw (replaces bronze chisel)
bronze plates + steam saw --> lumbermill (increases wood output)
charcoal furnace + gears + conveyor --> rolling charcoal maker (to feed
	the blast furnace)
bronze plates + gears --> steam drill
gears + steam drill --> water pump (hooks up to boiler to never run out of
	water)
bronze plates + water pump --> ore washer
bronze plates + steam hammer + more gears --> steam mining machine
bronze plates + steam drill + more gears --> steam dirt moving machine
bronze plates + gears --> steam hammer (replaces bronze hammer)
bronze plates --> bronze armor, bronze weapons, 3rd great exploration - gain
	iron, rubber, lead, aluminum
bronze plates + clay + gears --> blast furnace
iron ore + charcoal (blast furnace) --> steel ingot

All items will be sorted into categorized groups.  At some point, the player
will no longer need earlier groups, but focus on the later groups

Map will be a scrollable map, with limited size & fixed layout.  Player will
gain access to new areas as they progress.

Small explorations yield additional resource stashes of existing unlocked
materials.  Each one costs 10% more in goods, but increases in possible yields

Great explorations yield new resource types, and have a fixed cost

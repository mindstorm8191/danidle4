##DanIdle

This is a browser-based idle game where users climb a tech tree, starting from nothing but sticks & dirt, and working their way up to future tech.

This game is available to play online at http://danidle.netlify.com

The game is still under development, but currently offers about 10 minutes of play. There's lots of features to add, some for early-game, and lots of others for late-game.

More information about this can be found in the Github Wiki for this project.
